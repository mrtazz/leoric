NAME
  leoric - initialize code repositories from skeleton folders
SYNOPSIS
  leoric [-hqV] [-s skeleton directory] [-I macro includes]
         [-n project name] [-t project type]
DESCRIPTION
  leoric is a shell script to initialize code repositories from a set of
  skeleton files. This means you can set the default layout of your projects
  by type once and reuse it for each new project you start. This is most
  helpful for things you share between most of your projects like README
  scaffolds, LICENSE files, or contributing guidelines.
